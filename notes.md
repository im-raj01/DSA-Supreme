An internal node (also known as an inner node, inode for short, or branch node) is any node of a tree that has child nodes.Similarly, an external node (also known as an outer node, leaf node, or terminal node) is any node that does not have child nodes.

What is a Full Binary Tree? 
A full binary tree is a binary tree with either zero or two child nodes for each node. 

Full Binary Tree Theorem:
Let T be a nonempty, full binary tree Then:
  If T has I internal nodes, the number of leaves is L = I + 1.

  Data:
number of nodes :n
Formula:
Number of Unlabeled binary trees =
(2n)!/(n+1)!n!
